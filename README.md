# KeyboardLess
A "game" where you try and type words using your scrollwheel.


## Status
Functional, but only the extreme basics. I don't plan on adding anything else.

## How to Play
Each time you play, a new random word will be selected. When you start scrolling, the timer will start and the letter will change depending on how you scroll. Scrolling up will cycle through the alphabet forward and vice versa. When you are on the correct letter, press down on the scroll wheel to type that letter, repeat for all letters in the word.
